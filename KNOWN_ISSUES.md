# Known Issues & Minor Bugs

## üêõ Current Issues

### Repository Cleanup Needed (High Priority)
**Status:** Known, Needs Action  
**Description:** The repository contains many redundant scripts and old configuration files:
- Multiple deployment scripts with overlapping functionality
- Outdated server versions (server.js, server_sqlite.js variations)
- Old backup files and test scripts scattered throughout
- Configuration files for different environments mixed together

**Impact:** Developer confusion, deployment uncertainty, maintenance overhead  
**Solution:** Move old files to `archive/` folder, keep only current production files  
**Priority:** Should be addressed before next major development cycle

### Image Generation Database Schema Error (High Priority)
**Status:** Active Bug, Production Impact  
**Description:** When creating games and generating images on production server:
- Error: "Virhe: Failed to save image info: SQLITE_ERROR: table post_images has no column named generation_params"
- Image generation succeeds but metadata fails to save
- May impact image retrieval and regeneration features

**Impact:** Images generate but metadata is lost  
**Solution:** Add missing `generation_params` column to production database  
**SQL Fix:** `ALTER TABLE post_images ADD COLUMN generation_params TEXT;`

### Audio Generation Missing Playback UI (Medium Priority)
**Status:** Known, Feature Gap  
**Description:** Sound generation is successful but there's no obvious way for players or GM to listen to generated audio:
- Audio files are created and stored
- No playback controls in the UI
- Users don't know when audio is ready
- No indication of audio availability in posts

**Impact:** Generated audio features unusable without playback interface  
**Solution:** Add audio player controls and status indicators to post interface

### Image Display After Generation (Minor)
**Status:** Known, Low Priority  
**Description:** After generating an AI image for a post, there's a small loading delay where:
- The post appears immediately in the thread
- The generated image takes a few extra seconds to appear in the post
- Refreshing the page shows both post and image correctly

**Impact:** Cosmetic only - no functionality lost  
**Workaround:** Wait a few seconds or refresh the page  
**Root Cause:** Timing between post reload and image loading

### Suboptimal Image Resolution (Medium Priority)
**Status:** Known, Improvement Needed  
**Description:** Currently using 512x512 resolution for SD 3.5 Medium generation
- Current: 512x512 (1:1 aspect ratio, 262,144 pixels)
- Optimal: 768x1152 (0.667 aspect ratio, 884,736 pixels) or 1152x768 (1.5 aspect ratio)

**Impact:** Lower quality AI generation than possible  
**Solution:** Update canvas and generation to use optimal resolutions  
**Reference:** SD 3.5 Medium performs best at 768x1152/1152x768 resolutions  

### Duplicate Game Ordering Pages (Medium Priority)
**Status:** Known, Needs Consolidation  
**Description:** Players currently have two different pages to create AI GM games:
- `/hml/gm-selection.html` - Dedicated GM selection with detailed profiles
- `/hml/order-game.html` - Game ordering with GM selection embedded

**Impact:** User confusion, duplicate functionality  
**Solution:** Consolidate into single, clear game creation flow  
**Recommendation:** Keep gm-selection.html as primary interface, redirect from order-game or merge features

### Game Initiation Needs Enhancement (High Priority)
**Status:** Known, Feature Gap  
**Description:** Current game creation only asks for basic info (name, description, genre). Initial game experience lacks:
- Opening scene image generation
- Rich backstory/setting description  
- Clear initial choices for players
- Immersive atmosphere setting
- Future: Background music/soundscape integration

**Impact:** Games start with minimal context and engagement  
**Solution:** Enhance AI GM initial post generation to include:
1. Generated scene-setting image
2. Rich environmental description
3. Character/situation context  
4. Multiple meaningful choice options for players
5. Integration hooks for future audio features

### Server Stability
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Description:** The Node.js server occasionally stops responding and needs to be restarted
**Solution:** Use the restart command from `testserver.md`:
```bash
export AWS_REGION=eu-north-1 && export AWS_BUCKET_NAME=kuvatjakalat && node js/server_sqlite_new.js &
```

## ‚úÖ Recently Fixed Issues

### Style Preset Validation Error (Fixed: 2025-06-07)
- **Issue:** Stability AI rejected 'sketch' as invalid style_preset
- **Solution:** Use 'line-art' as base style for all sketch generations
- **Status:** Resolved

### Posts Not Appearing After Creation (Fixed: 2025-06-07)
- **Issue:** New posts weren't visible until page refresh
- **Root Cause:** Beats endpoint only showed first post per beat
- **Solution:** Modified endpoint to return ALL posts in array
- **Status:** Resolved

### Database Schema Mismatch (Fixed: 2025-06-07)
- **Issue:** Image generation failed due to wrong column names
- **Root Cause:** Server expected `metadata` and `game_id` columns that didn't exist
- **Solution:** Updated INSERT query to match actual table schema
- **Status:** Resolved

### Character Dropdown vs Sketch Input (Fixed: 2025-06-07)
- **Issue:** Old character-based image generation conflicted with new sketch system
- **Solution:** Replaced character dropdown with doodle canvas + style selection
- **Status:** Resolved

## üîß Workarounds & Tips

### Image Generation
- **Best Results:** Draw simple, clear sketches with bold strokes
- **Style Impact:** Use 'Comic' for colorful illustrations, 'Sketch' for line art
- **Prompt Tips:** Combine descriptive text with sketch for best control
