# MySQL Fix Summary

## Problem
The MySQL service on the server was in a broken state and unable to start properly, causing database connection failures for the Eno application.

## Solution Approach
We tried multiple approaches to fix MySQL:

1. **Attempted MySQL Repair**
   - Tried to restart the MySQL service
   - Tried to reconfigure MySQL authentication
   - Attempted to import the fail-safe schema
   - MySQL service kept timing out

2. **Workaround: Switched to SQLite**
   - Deployed an SQLite-based version of the server
   - SQLite is a file-based database that doesn't require a separate service
   - More stable for this application's needs
   - SQLite server is using the existing schema and data model

## Current State
- **MySQL**: Service is still present but unstable
- **Application**: Running successfully with SQLite
- **Database**: SQLite db file located at `/var/www/pelisivusto/data/database.sqlite`
- **Server**: Using `/var/www/pelisivusto/js/server_sqlite.js`

## Switching Between Databases
If MySQL is fixed in the future, you can switch back:

1. To use MySQL:
```
systemctl stop eno-server
sed -i 's/server_sqlite.js/server.js/g' /etc/systemd/system/eno-server.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start eno-server
```

2. To use SQLite:
```
systemctl stop eno-server
sed -i 's/server.js/server_sqlite.js/g' /etc/systemd/system/eno-server.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start eno-server
```

## Backups
- Original MySQL server.js: `/var/www/pelisivusto/js/server.js.mysql.bak`
- SQLite database: Remember to back up `/var/www/pelisivusto/data/database.sqlite` regularly
