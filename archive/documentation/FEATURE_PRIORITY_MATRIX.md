# Feature Priority Matrix

## Implementation Priority Analysis

Based on user impact, development complexity, and project goals, here's the recommended implementation order:

### ðŸŸ¢ HIGH PRIORITY - Start Immediately

#### 1. Chapter Archiving Restoration (2-3 weeks)
**Why First:**
- Restores existing broken functionality
- High user value (complete games properly)
- Relatively straightforward implementation
- Foundation for storyboard features

**Quick Wins:**
- Fix existing archive endpoints
- Add completion summaries
- Create basic storyboard view

#### 2. AI GM Selection System (3-4 weeks)
**Why Second:**
- Major user experience enhancement
- Uses existing portraits (no new assets needed)
- High replay value and engagement
- Foundation for other AI features

**Implementation Approach:**
- Start with 3-4 GM personalities as proof of concept
- Expand to full 14 once system is proven
- Focus on distinct personality differences

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Phase 2

#### 3. GM Suggestion Feature (2 weeks)
**Why Third:**
- Builds on GM personality system
- Helps with GM user experience
- Moderate complexity
- Good return on investment

**Dependencies:**
- Requires GM personality system
- Needs game context analysis

#### 4. Background Audio Generation (2-3 weeks)
**Why Fourth:**
- Nice-to-have enhancement
- Requires external API integration
- Additional infrastructure needs
- Audio storage and delivery complexity

**Considerations:**
- Stability AI Audio API costs
- Storage requirements for audio files
- Browser compatibility for audio playback

```

## Quick Implementation Guide

### For Chapter Archiving (Start Here)
1. Check existing `is_archived` column in chapters table
2. Look for archive-related endpoints in server files
3. Find archive UI components in frontend
4. Test what's working vs broken
5. Fix step by step

### For GM Personalities (Phase 2)
1. Extend `ai_gm_profiles` table with portrait references
2. Create GM personality seed data
3. Modify game creation to include GM selection
4. Update AI prompt generation to use personality traits

### For GM Suggestions (Phase 3)
1. Create context analysis function
2. Build suggestion generation endpoint
3. Add suggestion UI to GM post creation
4. Implement suggestion preview and editing

### For Audio Generation (Phase 4)
1. Set up Stability AI Audio API credentials
2. Create audio storage solution (S3)
3. Build audio generation service
4. Add audio player to post display

## Cost Considerations

### Stability AI Audio API
- **Cost**: ~$0.01-0.05 per audio generation
- **Budget**: $50-100/month for moderate usage
- **Mitigation**: Cache generated audio, limit generation frequency

### Storage Costs
- **Audio Files**: ~1-5MB per generated audio
- **Monthly Storage**: 100 audio files = ~500MB
- **CDN Costs**: Minimal for audio delivery

### AI API Costs (GM Suggestions)
- **Per Suggestion**: ~$0.001-0.01 depending on context size
- **Monthly Budget**: $20-50 for active usage
- **Optimization**: Cache similar contexts, limit suggestion frequency

## Success Metrics

### Chapter Archiving
- [ ] GMs can successfully archive chapters
- [ ] Archived chapters display properly in storyboard
- [ ] Export functionality works for completed games
- [ ] Players can browse their gaming history

### GM Personalities
- [ ] All 14 GM personalities are distinct and recognizable
- [ ] Player satisfaction with GM variety increases
- [ ] Game creation includes GM selection step
- [ ] GM responses match selected personality

### GM Suggestions
- [ ] Suggestions are contextually relevant
- [ ] GMs use suggestions at least 30% of the time
- [ ] Suggestion quality is high (user feedback)
- [ ] Feature reduces GM writer's block

### Audio Generation
- [ ] Audio generation completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Generated audio enhances game atmosphere
- [ ] Players engage with audio features
- [ ] Audio quality meets user expectations
