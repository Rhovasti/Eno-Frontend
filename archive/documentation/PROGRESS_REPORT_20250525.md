AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=kuvatjakalat
AWS_REGION=eu-north-1
STABILITY_API_KEY=***
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Image Generation

### Phase 2: Character Consistency (Priority: High)
1. **Character Profile System**
   - Add UI for creating character profiles
   - Store character descriptions and reference images
   - Character selection dropdown in image generation

2. **Improved Consistency Methods**
   - Fixed seed approach for same character
   - Style locking per character
   - Reference image system

3. **Database Schema**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE character_profiles (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INTEGER,
       game_id INTEGER,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       description TEXT,
       reference_image_url TEXT,
       style_preset TEXT,
       seed_value INTEGER
   );
   ```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Priority: Medium)
1. **Better Translation**
   - Integrate proper translation API
   - Support full Finnish sentences
   - Context-aware translations

2. **Image Management**
   - Multiple images per post
   - Image gallery view
   - Delete/regenerate options
   - Image captions

3. **Performance & UX**
   - Loading animations
   - Progress indicators
   - Error recovery
   - Batch generation

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)
1. **LoRA Training** (for perfect consistency)
   - Upload reference images
   - Train custom models per character
   - Much better consistency

2. **Style Presets**
   - Save custom style combinations
   - Game-specific styles
   - Artist style emulation

3. **Integration Features**
   - Auto-generate images for key story moments
   - Image-based story branching
   - Character portrait gallery

## ðŸ’¡ Immediate Next Actions

### Before Production Deployment:
1. **Bucket Policy** - Ensure S3 bucket allows public read
2. **Cost Controls** - Add user limits/credits
3. **Content Moderation** - Filter inappropriate prompts
4. **Error Handling** - Better user feedback
5. **Mobile Optimization** - Responsive image display

### Quick Wins:
1. Add "Regenerate" button for images
2. Show generation cost/credits
3. Add more style presets
4. Improve Finnish translations
5. Add image zoom/lightbox

## ðŸ“ˆ Usage Metrics to Track

Once deployed:
- Images generated per day
- Most common prompts
- Average generation time
- Error rates
- Storage usage
- API costs

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

Today we successfully:
1. **Launched dice rolls** to production
2. **Built a working AI image generation system**
3. **Integrated AWS S3 for image storage**
4. **Created a solid foundation** for future enhancements

The platform now has two major new features that enhance the role-playing experience!
