The shadowed figure stepped into the dim light of the tavern. Raindrops still clung to their cloak, glistening in the candlelight like tiny stars against the night sky. 

"I've traveled a long way," they said, voice barely above a whisper. "They say the answers I seek can be found here."

The innkeeper raised an eyebrow, continuing to polish the already gleaming mug in his hands. "Answers are a rare commodity these days, stranger. Rarer than gold in some places."

A smile crept across the traveler's face as they reached into their cloak, producing a small, ornate box. "Perhaps this might loosen some tongues."

The box bore strange markings - ancient symbols that seemed to shift and change when viewed from different angles. Even in the dim light, it was clear this was no ordinary artifact.

"Where did you get that?" the innkeeper asked, his hands now perfectly still.

"That," replied the traveler, "is precisely the beginning of my questions."
